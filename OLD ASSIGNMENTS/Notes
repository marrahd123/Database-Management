------EXAMPLES-----------
1) Using relations Likes(drinker, beer) and Frequents(drinker, bar), find the beers liked by at least one person who frequents Joe’s Bar.
SELECT beer FROM Likes, Frequents WHERE bar = 'Joe''s Bar' AND Frequents.drinker = Likes.drinker;

2.Example: Intersection
Using Likes(drinker, beer), Sells(bar, beer, price), and Frequents(drinker, bar), find the drinkers and beers such that:
The drinker likes the beer, and
The drinker frequents at least one bar that sells the beer.

WAY 1:

select Likes.drinker, Likes.beer
from Likes, Frequents, Sells
where Likes.Beer = Sells.beer AND Likes.drinker = Frequents.drinker AND Sells.bar = Frequents.bar;

SUBQUERY WAY:

select drinker,beer
from Likes L
where EXISTS (select * from Frequents F, Sells S (where F.bar = S.bar AND L.beer = S.beer AND F.drinker = L.drinker));

ANOTHER SOLUTION:

Select * from likes INTERSECT select drinker, beer from Sells, Frequents where Frequents.bar = Sells.bar;
